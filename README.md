This repo contains a selection of front-end projects and assignments done either for kicks or as part of SuperHi's Foundation HTML, CSS + Javascript course. As a consequence, in what might not be a huge surprise, the above pages involve HTML, CSS, and Javascript (via jQuery.)

Final websites can be found within each website's folder Read-Me file.
