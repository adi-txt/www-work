# 🏔 Himalayas 2017: A Photography Portfolio

This website implements a single page responsive-design photography portfolio with a lightbox –– coded from scratch using Javascript (via jQuery), HTML and CSS. The images used are low-resolution versions of photographs I took over the duration of two trips to the Himalayas in India in 2017.

Final website can be found [here][1].
